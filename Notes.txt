[!] 001. initial entry for mp fractal development program
[!] 002. git config --global core.editor "name of editor"
[!] 003. 7z a nose1.7z nose1.jpg
[!] 004. ctrl+f5, ctrl+t = insert_date with editplus format
[!] 005. when locked out unload  Malwarebytes—wait a while and restore…
	[!] 01. Remember if mp is running you will get this error!
	[!] 02. File should be released as soon as Malwarebytes is dead.
	[!] 03. Reload Malwarebytes as soon as possible after compile.
	[] 04.
[√] 006. mode to specify start and stop colors in increment of maxiter?
    [×] 01. No. maxiter would be too large—for now 1k? 512? Some fraction of maxiter?
    [√] 02. Allow user to specify with palname == SET:128 and the like…
    	[√] 1. {..} or name, ':' interval size as specification using repeat -k.
    	[] 2.
    [√] 03. Try switch to HSV for interpolation
    [] 04.
[√] 007. palette preview output? Based on magic palname?
	[√] 01. writeColors() allows viewing of palette as .ppm image file.
	[] 02.
[≈] 008. 🐛 BUG, translation method is off; x axis for sure, possibly y axis
	as well. Ongoing problem. SEE➥  #—011., #—012.
[√] 009. 🐛 BUG, nMax is incorrect.
	[√] 01. mset returns Parameter fixes this… SEE➥ #—015.
	[] 02.
[√]	010. Fixed elapsed routines to paranoid\ level.
[≈] 011. Test coord with MSet[02].JSON
	[≈] 01. #ifdef between Axis and coord
	[] 02.
[≈] 012. 🐛 BUG, mystery of black image for JSON 12, 13 and 14?
	[!] 01. this with coord enabled.
		[!] 1. no drift, went to completion.
		[]2.
	[≈] 02. try with axis enabled on JSON-14
		[!] 1. drift is there but 14 went to completion.
		[] 2.
	[!] 03. drift gone until FLT128 invoked.
		[!] 1. revised version with coord inline works w/14.
		[] 2.
	[] 04.
[√] 013. add ㎳ to elapsed?
[√] 014. 🐛 BUG, Where did lines from mand4 version of -r 10 go?
	[!] 01. rabbit hole—lines are a function of Zx/Zy versus complex Z
	[√] 02. difference is in how the Z code performs versus the Zx code.
	[] 03.
[√] 015. 🐛 BUG, fix nMax == 0;
	[√] 01. mand now returns Parameters.
	[] 02.
[≈] 016. 🐛 BUG mp, -x -0.65 -y 0 -m 0.3636363636363636 -w 3840 -l 2160 -r 10 -t 3 -f test[00].10.jpg FAIL
	[!] 01. Black image along with nMax == 0
	[!] 02. mp -j MSet[00].JSON -r 10 -t 5 -f test[00].10.jpg works as expected
	[!] 03. this during effort to recreate forces lines from over-iteration
	[] 04.
[√] 017. Find way to offer both Zx/Zy and complex Z
	[√] 01. Add -o for old parameter to indicate Zx/Zy, complex Z is default
	[√] 02. simple check for g.o, and inclusion of additional vars in color list (badly named…)
	[√] 03. Parse -o by name as well as number.
	[] 04.
[≈] 018. Add additional interpolation from Paul Bourke code…
	[√] 01. Add -b for bourke parameter to indicate interpolation
	[] 02.
[√] 019. take apart code from demm.c and implement distance estimator method along with Zx/Zy and complex Z
	[√] 01. mandel7.c working testbed for DEM/M approach. Also has working GiveRainbowColor.
	[√] 02. -o now becomes choice between three methods.
	[√] 03. Take apart current DEMM code and add result to if/elseif chain with color separation
	[] 04.
[√] 020. Add W:JSONfilename option to -j
[√] 021. Add MSetPot/CPM to methods.
	[√] 01. Possible 🐛 BUG. Shape looks nothing like the MSet.
		[√] 1. typo found and corrected, temp assignment was a transposition
		[] 2.
	[] 02.
[≈] 022. 🐛 BUG, -r 13 is broken in DEMM and MSETPOT
	[!] 01. Symptom is typical black screen image.
	[√] 02. Caused by Exps overflow.
	[×] 03. Formula reworked, but still a problem. Temporary fix is to disallow combination.
	[] 04.
[×] 023. Experiment with union of int and Rgb to convert from Rgb to int for writing to
		 screen. Start with rgb2int.
	[×] 01. Doesn't work for whatever reason.
	[] 02.
[√] 024. Parse name stack to small palette file. Develop routine to build actual palette from that.
   [≈] 01. SEE➥ #—018.
   [√] 02. Added buildColors(), parseRGB() and appendColors() to handle p.names/p.argc.
   [√] 03. 🐛 BUG in str2Rgb(), you can't break an if inside a for! AT&T classic bug!
   [√] 04. 🐛 BUG in writeColors, for palette size use colors.used, not colors.size.
   [] 05.
[√] 025. Add write palette routine. 100 high by length of palette wide.
	[√] 01. writeColors( color );
	[√] 02. given readColors() palette file becomes tradeable.
	[] 03.
[≈] 026. Work on making function names consistent. str2Rgb ➡ str2RGB.
[!] 027. /**+return to document functions/routines… #DOXYGEN
[!] 028. /**f+tab to document file… #DOXYGEN
[!] 029. ctrl+shift+i to display snippets with tab keys… #DOXYGEN
[!] 030. Doxygen snippets: SEE➥ #—027., #—028.
	[!] 01. /**+tab function header #DOXYGEN
	[!] 02. /**l+tab line annotation #DOXYGEN
	[!] 03. /**t+tab typedef header #DOXYGEN
	[!] 04. /**d+tab define header #DOXYGEN
	[] 05.
[√] 031. 🐛 BUG -m is broken in mp vr0.027
	[√] 01. forgot to update .radius along with .diameter
		[!] 1. problem from magn conversion
		[] 2.
	[≈] 02. now experimenting with conversion of magnification to diameter
		[≈] 1. trying p.diameter = 1.0 / ( p.magnify / 3.0 ); seems close but still problems at depth
		[] 2.
	[] 03.
[≈] 032. Change MSetPot to MSetCPM and MSETPOT to MSETCPM
	[] 01.
[] 033.
